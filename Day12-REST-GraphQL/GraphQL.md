# REST API

Representational State Transfer (REST) is a software architecture that imposes conditions on how an API should work. REST was initially created as a guideline to manage communication on a complex network like the internet. You can use REST-based architecture to support high-performing and reliable communication at scale. You can easily implement and modify it, bringing visibility and cross-platform portability to any API system.

## API

An application programming interface (API) defines the rules that you must follow to communicate with other software systems. Developers expose or create APIs so that other applications can communicate with their applications programmatically. 

## Uniform Interface

The uniform interface is fundamental to the design of any RESTful webservice. It indicates that the server transfers information in a standard format. The formatted resource is called a representation in REST. This format can be different from the internal representation of the resource on the server application.

Uniform interface imposes four architectural constraints:

1. <i><b>Requests should identify resources</b></i>. They do so by using a uniform resource identifier.
2. <i><b>Clients have enough information</b></i> in the resource representation to modify or delete the resource if they want to. The server meets this condition by sending metadata that describes the resource further.
3. <i><b>Clients receive information about how to process the representation further</b></i>. The server achieves this by sending self-descriptive messages that contain metadata about how the client can best use them.
4. <i><b>Clients receive information about all other related resources they need to complete a task</b></i>. The server achieves this by sending hyperlinks in the representation so that clients can dynamically discover more resources.
